# Relational Properties Project


## About This Project
* #### This project allows users to check the relational properties of a set of ordered pairs.

* #### This project allows users to find ordered pairs to satisfy a relational property.



### Why This project
Beyond Mathematics, relational properties are important in Computer Science as they allow for practical applications in databases, graph theory, and formal logic. For instance, when designing a database schema, understanding these properties helps ensure the integrity and consistency of the data model. In graph databases, relationships often exhibit these properties, allowing for efficient querying and analysis. In formal logic, these properties are foundational for reasoning about relationships and dependencies.


### Getting Started
This project requires local execution. Therefore, to run this project, one can simply download the raw files and run them locally.
